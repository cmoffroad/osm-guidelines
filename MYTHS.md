## Common Myths about OpenStreetMap (OSM)

### My mobile app has nothing to do with OpenStreetMap

Unless you are using Google, Apple, or Bing maps (you should not for offroad), all other mobile applications (maps.me, alltrails, gaia, kamoot, mapy.cz, osmand…) rely on OpenStreetMap data to display maps.

### Mobile applications based on OSM have always up-to-date maps:

I wish. Mobile maps are typically updated every 2 to 6 months, sometimes even longer. Only OsmAnd Pro due to its different rendering technology allows getting data refreshed within 1 hour.

### 4WD tracks are always tagged as “track” [ — — — ]:

Most yes but not all. A “track” only means the main purpose of the road is agricultural or forestry, and some may even be paved. The main road between villages and attractions should be tagged as “unclassified” while sections of double tracks should be “residential” if they are within a settlement area.

### Roads are always paved [ _______ ]

Nope. Standard mobile and Garmin applications do not rely on the surface tag (unpaved vs paved). Roads in general are tagged based on their importance in the road network, not based on their type of surface.

### All roads, tracks, and trails exist and can be fully relied on:

Sadly not. Most roads, tracks, and trails have been added first with satellite imagery, some by local mappers, others remotely by companies like Facebook, Grab… While most urban roads may be correct, remote tracks and trails could be wrong and require ground confirmation with GPS. 

### Road classification for existing roads can be assumed to be correct:

Not yet. Road classifications have been only recently agreed upon and documented in the Thailand wiki. While most classifications may be correct, many will need to be upgraded due to conflicting definitions, vandalism, or lazy mappers.

### Default satellite imagery in OpenStreetMap is the best:

Unfortunately not. Bing imagery in Thailand is most of the time outdated (5+ years in rural areas) and misaligned. A much better alternative is Maxar, available in the layers menu. Older Bing imagery can still be very useful to find visible forest traces, but watch out for misalignment issues.
