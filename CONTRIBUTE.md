## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE FURTHER ?

### Add missing `surface=paved` or `surface=unpaved` to existing roads
Make sure to split the road segment share different surface conditions.

> Note: it's ok to use a more precise surface type however beware some terms are too vague and misused e.g. `dirt`, `ground` and will be replaced with `unpaved`

### Add missing `source=GPS` tag to road segments that have been confirmed via a ground survey
Make sure to split the road segment if part of it has not been surveyed.

> Do NOT tag an entire road segment if you havent surveyed the whole length. There might be a private property gate, an impassable section...

### Tag paths only suitable for hiking and extreme sports as `highway=footway`
Best way to know? Ask nearby villagers/farmers if a small motorcycle cannot go.
Or leave this to advanced riders to decide if suitable for beginner/moderate skills. 

### Tag paths frequently used by locals on small motorcycles as `highway=path` + `motorcycle=yes`
Best way to know? Ask nearby villagers/farmers if a small motorcycle can go.

### Tag paths large enough for a 4WD as `highway=track`
Many double tracks have been incorrectly tagged as path due to grown vegetation, poor surface conditions and lazy mappers.
Best way to know? Ask nearby villagers/farmers if a pickup track can go.

### Convert `highway=path` to `waterway=stream` or `waterway=river`

Some sections of riverbed and creeks have been wrongly mapped as path.
If there is no clear path along the river or the stream, remove the path and make sure to add the necessary `waterway=stream` or `waterway=river` (large, multiple meters).

### Indicate the end of the road

- Add to the last node of the road [noexit=yes](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:noexit) when there was no possibility to travel further. This prevents other mappers to have do more ground survey to find out. 
- Use [fixme=continue](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:fixme) when the road continues but you havenâ€™t been able to map it, and optionally describe the reason if there was any obstacle. e.g. [fixme=continue. tree blocking the way.](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:fixme)

### Indicate how vehicles go through waterway crossings:

- If the [waterway](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:waterway) (stream or river) is missing, add a small section crossing the road.
- Add [ford=yes](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:ford) at the node intersection when vehicles must cross the river/stream. 
- Add a [bridge=yes](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:bridge) + [layer=1](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:layer) road segment when traffic can go over a bridge.

### Upload your GPS recordings

Uploaded [GPS traces](https://www.openstreetmap.org/traces) are visible as a map Overlay in the [OSM ID editor](https://www.openstreetmap.org/edit) and help improve accuracy of road geometries that may be misaligned due to poor GPS signal.
